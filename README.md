AI-based helmet detection system using YOLOv8 and ultrasonic sensor to enable smart vehicle ignition and improve road safety.
# Ultrasonic Helmet Detector using YOLOv8

## 📌 Overview
This project is a smart road safety prototype that ensures a bike starts only when the rider is wearing a helmet.

The system detects the rider using an ultrasonic sensor and activates a camera to verify helmet usage using computer vision.

---

## Features
✔ Detects rider presence using ultrasonic sensor  
✔ Activates camera only when rider is detected  
✔ Detects helmet using YOLOv8  
✔ Ignition starts only if helmet is worn  
✔ Promotes automated road safety

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Embedded System Integration

---

## How It Works
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects rider presence  
2. Camera activates automatically  
3. YOLOv8 model detects helmet  
4. If helmet detected → ignition ON  
5. If no helmet → ignition OFF
